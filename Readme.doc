To use this GUI on a Cubex extracted datacube:

1. There must be a folder containing: 


    (a) A folder named "NB" that will contain narrow band and object masked iages of all the object within in that cube extracted by CubEx.
        The narrow band images will have a name type: "NB_{obj_id}.fits"
        The object masked images will have a name type: "Obj_Mask_{obj_id}.fits"
        (Names are case sensitive)

    (b) A folder named "spec" that will contain the optimally extracted spectra for all the objects wihtin that cube extracted by Cubex.
        The files will have a name type: "spec_{obj_id}.dat"

    (c) Finally, it must have the final object catalog extracted by CubEx that contains all the source Id, centroid, ra ,dec etc of the 
        extracted sources. The extension of the file should be "*.cat". Make sure there is no other file in that specific folder with 
        the same extension.

To run in terminal: ./{this gui-file name}.py {the complete name of the .cat file described above in (c)} 


Your comments will be saved in a file named "My_comments.txt". The columns are (object_id, redshift, comment). The redshift here will be
the value displayed in the "redshift" label while pressing the "save" button beside the "comment" bar. Multiple comments on the same object 
saved at different instances will be saved as different entries in separate lines.
